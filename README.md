Feruchemy 0.1.0
=========

This mod adds the basics of [Feruchemy](http://coppermind.net/wiki/Feruchemy) from Brandon Sanderson's book series *Mistborn*. 

This mod is currently updated for `Minecraft 1.12.2` and `Forge 13.20.0.2262`, but is VERY UNFINISHED!

This mod depends on [Baubles](https://github.com/Azanor/Baubles) and [Allomancy](https://github.com/legobmw99/Allomancy)

Please verify and report any issues!
